# Code-Refractor

## Description
    As you will see this was my first time doing something like this and it was a lot of fun. what we did was change some code to make it look more readable and accessible to people who are interested in learning code. Instead of seeing one tag for everything you get to see different tags to descriibe the code better. Also we optimized the CSS to again make it easier for people to understand. It helped me learn and understand more than i thought, now i feel more like i know i can do it. 

## Task that were accomplished
    - Changed tags to be easier to understand.
    - Optimizied the CSS to be more accessible.
    - The page had mutiple adjusmtents but was able to keep it the same.
